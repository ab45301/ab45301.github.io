	<h1>Easy Guide to Concerts in Atlanta</h1>
</div>
	<h4> Atlanta, Georgia is home to many options for someone wanting to enjoy himself or herself and have a good time in the city. You can choose from a variety of restaurants to parks to music venues in the Atlanta area. Personally going to concerts is how I like to spend my spare time, whether I go to a small show with a capacity in the low hundreds or to an arena where I share my experience with thousands of other people. No matter what genre of music you listen to, there will always be an option to suit your style almost any day of the week and whether you listen to underground artists or highly recognized artists, you can always find some shows. Here I will be sharing some of my favorite music venues that range in price and capacity and I will also share some of my tips that I have picked up along my long and exciting road of going to concerts.

	<h2>Tips</h2>
	<p> Some of my tips and tricks that I have picked up involve ways to go to concerts for cheap or even free, do’s and don’ts at certain venues, and how to go to as many as four concerts a month. <br>
<br>
Lets start with ways to go to a concert for cheap. There are many ways to go to a concert for as little money as possible, one way is to use the website Groupon. I have used Groupon to get discounted tickets a couple of times, last month I purchased tickets to see Halsey for only $40 where the original tickets would have cost $70+. Another way to get cheap tickets are to buy them the day they go on sale. Buying your tickets the day they go on sale will guarantee that you will buy them for face value, because as time goes on the prices will get higher and higher. Also if you buy your tickets from the venue’s box office instead of online, you get out of paying extra for fees. Now going to concerts for free is a little tricky and it takes a lot of luck, but if you listen to your local radio stations, chances are they are giving out free concert tickets to a lucky caller or even their social media platforms can have giveaways to win tickets. It seems like a long shot but if you’re lucky it can happen.<br>
<br>
With all of those tips on going to concerts for cheap and a few other tips this is how I, a broke college student on a budget, can go to so many concerts. If you are up for expanding your taste in music to artists that are not on the radio, then their concerts always cost less at smaller more intimate venues. Most of the time the prices for an underground artist’s ticket can range from $10-$50. Some of my favorite small venues are listed below such as Center Stage and The Loft. These smaller shows are very intimate with the artist and you can feel more connected to them, which in turn can make the concert more enjoyable. Also, a little bonus tip, many of the artists that perform at small venues will come out after the show and you will get the chance to meet them, talk to them, and get a picture taken with them.<br>
<br>
<h3>Do's and Don'ts</h3>
<ol>
	<li>DO become familiar with the venue</li>
	<li>DO buy merchandise, drinks, food during sets (there's less people)</li>
	<li>DO get to the venue early if you have General Admission to get a "good" spot</li>
	<li>DO uber to the venue so you don't have to deal with driving</li>
	<li>DON'T forget to hydrate before the show, it can get hot and crowded</li>
	<li>DON'T wear impractical outfits, you'll regret it. Trust me</li>
	<li>DON'T be that obnoxious fan or rude to the artists, they're normal people</li>
	<li>DON'T forget to have fun</li>
</ol>
